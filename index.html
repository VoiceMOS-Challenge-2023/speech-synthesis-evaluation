<h2>Speech Synthesis Evaluation</h2>

<p>
We have written a review paper on subjective and evaluation of speech synthesis (TODO more info once it's published).  
This webpage contains links to the papers cited in our review, as well as other interesting and relevant papers we have found since then.
